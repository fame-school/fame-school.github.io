<b>INFORMATION -- Flooding in Austria</b> <br/>
This weekend, a major storm swept over Austria, causing regional flooding and leading to some parts of the public transport system to be currently disrupted.
<br/>
<br/>
The latest information is that the primary connections between Linz and Vienna (incl. Vienna Airport) should be up and running by Tuesday. 
Please stand by for more information and feel free to contact us at any time.

Over the course of the past decades, software engineering has reached a level of maturity that requires 
an ever greater use of modelling. For over two decades, the MODELS conference has served as the premier 
venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to the use of model-based 
approaches in the development of complex software systems. During this time, many of its keynote speakers 
have pointed out the critical role that education plays in expanding the use of models in software development. 

The **School on Foundations and Advances of Model-Based Engineering (FAME)** aims at giving a comprehensive understanding 
of the body of knowledge that constitutes the foundations of software and systems modelling. FAME, organized in 
co-location with the MODELS conference, offers its participants a set of carefully selected lectures dealing with 
various aspects of modelling. The objective is to provide each attendee with sufficient information to understand 
the main foundations and current challenges in the use of modelling and modelling languages, and also to have a 
clear picture of the most recent advances in the field.

Our lecturers are recognized experts in model-based approaches with outstanding  pedagogical skills. 
The FAME program comprises a balanced mix of academic and industrial contributions. The academic 
lecturers will provide an overview of their research themes, including descriptions of the state 
of the art as well as an outline of emerging trends and challenges. The contributions of the 
industrial lecturers will focus on results achieved in the practical application of modelling 
in industrial contexts.

This school is targeted at Master's or PhD students, post-docs, lecturers, academics, 
and professionals from industry who are interested in the above topics.

Topics addressed during FAME include: 
- Definition, use, and analysis of model-based generative and re-engineering approaches
- Design and implementation of modelling languages, their instrumentation with model editors, interpreters and generators, the integration of multiple modeling languages to achieve a system view, and the validation of both models and tools.
- Tools, meta-tools, and language workbenches for model-based engineering, including model management and scalable model repositories.
- Model transformation languages
- Collaborative modelling to address team management issues
- Model-based variability management for software and system product lines
- Evolution and co-evolution (model/metamodel)
- Modelling for specific challenges such as collaboration, scalability, security, interoperability, adaptability, flexibility, maintainability, dependability, reuse, energy efficiency, sustainability, and uncertainty.
- New paradigms, formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc.
- Use and application of LLMs & generative AI for MDE 

The school will also provide lectures to help students prepare for their academic and industrial career. 
This includes lectures on scientific methods and best practices, empirical methods, paper writing, 
composition of research project proposals, etc. 

FAME is envisaged as a forum for exchange between its participants, and includes hands-on experience classes 
and poster sessions that are open to all attendees. The school will take place at [Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria](venue),
in the three days preceding the start of the [MODELS'24 conference](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2024){:target="_blank"}.

### We look forward to your participation!
