In recent years, Model-based Software Engineering (MBSE) is exploiting the latest progress made in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve increasingly complex problems. By leveraging AI in MBSE, we can provide 
modelers with intelligent assistants, self-adapting tools, advanced automation, etc. that improve their productivity 
and help them develop higher-quality software. This shift from mostly manual tasks to AI-assisted and 
AI-automated tasks allows modelers to spend their time on the tasks where they provide the most value. In this talk, 
I will give an overview of some of the latest advancements in the application of AI to Model-driven Engineering, 
and I will discuss open issues and the short-term and long-term challenges that we will be facing in the future.
