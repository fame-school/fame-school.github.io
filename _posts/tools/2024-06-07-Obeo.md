**Abstract**
Eclipse Sirius is an open source project dedicated to the design and utilization of graphical modeling languages 
with a low code approach. 
This project started in 2007 in collaboration with Thales through the first implementation Eclipse Sirius Desktop, 
an Eclipse-based language workbench. For a decade, Sirius Desktop has been used for numerous desktop projects but 
these required installation on the users’ machines. To simplify the deployment phase, we proposed in 2019 the first 
release of a new cloud-native implementation of Sirius named Eclipse Sirius Web, based on the same principles of 
Sirius Desktop and refined with our experience. In this talk, we will look at the main principles of the Sirius 
project before focusing on Sirius Web. We will finish with a demo of Sirius Web where we will implement in an 
iterative way a small DSL with both diagram and form representation.
