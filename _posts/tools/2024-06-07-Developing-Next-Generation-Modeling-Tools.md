**Abstract**
This session introduces how to the build modern web-based diagram editors for your tools with ease using 
open source technologies! We will shed light on the flexibility these tools and their underlying technology 
stack entail and how you can improve your existing or develop entirely new diagram editors. Concretely, 
we will elaborate on the newest community additions to the GLSP platform and Sprotty, and modern tools 
like bigUML that have been developed on top of these technologies. We will in particular explore three 
key areas of innovation and flexibility: Synchronous Diagram Editing, Testability of diagram editors,
and Accessibility of diagram editors. In this talk, we will not only demonstrate new features, but also delve 
into the underlying technologies, discuss best practices, and show how your research can benefit from proper tool support.
