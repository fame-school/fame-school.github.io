**Abstract**

This lecture sets the stage for the more detailed MDE topic presentations that follow.
The core concepts and terminology of software and systems modelling are introduced.
A classification of the different types and uses of models is given. More importantly,
relationships (such as consistency) between these different types and uses are introduced.
