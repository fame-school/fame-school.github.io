**Abstract**
This session will cover common model management activities within the context of model-driven engineering, 
including model-to-model and model-to-text transformation, model validation, comparison, and merging. 
We will demonstrate a selection of these activities using languages and 
tools from the Eclipse Epsilon toolkit ([https://eclipse.org/epsilon](https://eclipse.org/epsilon)).
